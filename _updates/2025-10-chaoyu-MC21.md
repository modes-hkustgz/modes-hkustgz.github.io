Chaoyu delivers presentation in George Washington University, Washington, DC, United States, at Oct 29, 2025.
Amid growing interest in drone-enhanced food delivery, most studies have focused on operational challenges, leaving the strategic and economic implications understudied. This talk addresses that gap by developing a parsimonious economic model of on-demand instant delivery market that introduces drones alongside human couriers, capturing strategic interactions between consumers, couriers, and the platform. The model employs a linear city framework with spatially distributed consumers with heterogeneous delivery valuations. Key factors are endogenized, including drone efficiency, pricing, and courier supply. We compare outcomes under three market structures (perfect competition, monopoly, and Bertrand duopoly) across three delivery modes: human-only, drone-only, and bi-modal. Analysis reveals that drone adoption expands delivery coverage beyond the baseline human-only mode and is most cost-effective for long-distance orders. In the bi-modal setting, non-overlapping service regions emerge due to rational consumer choice, yielding maximum social welfare across all market structures. Market structure also influences pricing: under duopoly competition, the introduction of drones drives down delivery fees for remote customers. However, increasing drone penetration diminishes the surplus of human couriers, thereby raising equity concerns for the workforce. Numerical simulations with real data validate our findings, demonstrating that integrating drones significantly expands delivery coverage and enhances customer surplus across all market structures, thereby positioning customers as the primary beneficiaries. These findings provide managerial insights for platform strategy and highlight policy interventions, such as drone subsidies or profit redistribution, to ensure the efficiency gains from drone adoption do not come at the expense of equity.
